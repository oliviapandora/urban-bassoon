‚ùóNote: This password generator project is from Invent with Python + you can find it [here](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/exercise19/)

I enjoyed this project, but Python Software Foundation recommends using the **secrets module** *instead* of the random module. 
More information about this security practice [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#module-secrets) I'm still feel like a newbie when it comes to Python, but reading the documentation has helped me get a better sense of the language + correct myself when it's needed.
